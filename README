The BeagleBone 4Gb 16-Bit NAND module is used with the BeagleBone Memory Expansion to provide NAND Flash memory for BeagleBone. This module features an asynchronous 4Gb NAND Flash memory with 16-bit data width. The memory device operates at 3.3V and uses highly multiplexed 8-bit (I/Ox) to transfer commands, addresses, and data. The BeagleBone 4Gb 16-Bit NAND module is installed on top of the BeagleBone Memory Expansion Cape via a 40-position header and 40-position socket.
